In the post effects panel it is possible to create a stack of effects, affecting the final render composition.

The effects in the stack are applied <strong>top to bottom</strong>. <strong>Reordering</strong> the effects is done by drag and dropping one effect box at a time, activated by pressing down on the top side of the effect box. The cursor is changed to a pointer upon hovering on the draggable area.

<div class="well info">
To see the applied post effects, make sure you have post effects <strong>enabled</strong> in the canvas'/viewport's top menu.

### Effect Controls

In the effect's box various inputs are available to customize it's output.

	<strong>Quick Tip: Create Slider Controllers</strong>
	<p>
		The sliders are there to provide sane defaults of the particular value its controlling. - However, it is possible to override the value by either editing the number or click-and-dragging on the text input next to the slider.
