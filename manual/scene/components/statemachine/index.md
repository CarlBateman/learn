title: State Machine Component
---

The state machine is a visual programming tool that makes it really fast for you to prototype your project.

In a state machine we have Behaviours that contains States and States contains Actions.
Behaviours are layers of interaction being executed at the same time.
States are steps for those behaviours.
Behaviors are layers of interaction.
By default a behavior contains a initial state
Controls such as shading mode, gizmo switch, camera selection can be found in the canvas menu.
In the default state click the add action button.
The Add action pop ups gives you access to pre-made blocks that you can use. As the earth needs to spin I will add a
rotate action.
Actions are categorized by types.
Search for the pick action
Controls such as shading mode, gizmo switch, camera selection can be found in the canvas menu.
When the user will click on the user the Pick action will be fired and connect to the next state.
State to go to once the user
clicked/picked the earth
Controls such as shading mode, gizmo switch, camera selection can be found in the canvas menu. Now add a new state to your behavior and a rotate action to it.
You can now connect the Pick action to the new state that I called ‘Rotate State’.
State to go to once the user
clicked/picked the earth
Rename your state here
Controls such as shading mode, gizmo switch, camera selection can be found in the canvas menu.
Adjust the rotation parameters to make your earth spin.
Here the earth will rotate 10 degrees every frame on the Y axis.
Controls such as shading mode, gizmo switch, camera selection can be found in the canvas menu.
