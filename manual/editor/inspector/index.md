The Inspector, or the Entity Inspector, is used to interact with the entities in the scene. If you haven’t already, now is a good time to catch up on the fundamentals on Entities and Components! When an entity is selected, like the “Satellite” entity in the screenshot above, the Inspector shows the entity and its components.

The Inspector panel

Let’s talk about the various parts of the Inspector. At the top, we see and can edit the entity’s name. We can also add components to the entity, or show the entity options. These options let us expand the entity panel to see some information about the entity and any tags it might have, as well as adding the entity to the asset library or hide the entity. The type-specific component options will look different for each component type. In this case, the expanded component panel shows the transform options. The general component options can be used to reset the component’s values or to delete the component.

Scene Settings and Information
There is a special case of the Inspector. Apart from showing entity options, the panel can also show settings for the scene. The scene settings are accessed by selection the scene at the top of the hierarchy menu, and includes settings for handling snapshots, changing document size, setting a skybox or background color, adding post effects, viewing scene details and more.
