With the collaboration and sharing feature <em>Organizations</em> just released, we thought it would be a good idea to go over some of the basics of how to work with it.
<h2>What are Organizations?</h2>
Organizations is a feature enabling teams to collaborate efficiently. Included are tools to manage and share assets with other users and work on the same projects. <a href="http://goocreate.com/pricing" target="_blank">Look here</a> for pricing info.
<h2>How to Create an Organization</h2>
<ol>
	<li>If you don't have an account, create one as a regular, non-paying user at <a href="https://app.goocreate.com/register">https://app.goocreate.com/register</a>.</li>
	<li>You should be taken to the <strong>Dashboard</strong>. Click <em>Organizations</em>.</li>
	<li>Click <em>Create Organization</em>.</li>
	<li>Enter your Organization and payment details.</li>
	<li>Press <em>Create</em>.</li>
</ol>
You can now reach your new Organization from the Dashboard.

<h2>How to Add Members</h2>
Adding members to an Organization is very easy. All you need to know is the <em>user name</em> of the member you want to add. While looking at the Organization details, click the <em>Members</em> tab and select <em>Manage</em>. Now simply type a username, and click <em>Add</em>. Note that the input field will turn <span style="color: #339966">green </span>if the username is valid.

<h2>How to Add a Project</h2>
If a Project is created within an Organization, all members will be able to work with it. Very useful! Either click the <em>Create Project</em> button in the <em>Projects</em> tab of the Organization, or go directly to <em>Projects</em> in the left hand menu. In either case, note that the Organization is selected in the drop-down menu.

<h2>How to Work with Locks</h2>
A Lock is a mechanism to prevent weird things to happen if two or more users want to edit the same project at the same time. At this time, you simply can't. Only one user at a time can own a Lock on a Scene. That user will be the only one able to edit. When entering a scene that another using is viewing or editing, you are given the opportunity to <em>steal</em> the Lock. If you do, you'll get the exclusive rights and the other user will get kicked out. Communication is encouraged!

<img class="wp-image-1214 size-full" src="http://goocreate.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2014/12/org7.png" alt="org7" /> If you try to enter a Scene with a Lock on it, you can choose to take over or exit.
<h2>How to Add Assets to the Organization</h2>
A really neat feature of Organizations is the ability to share Assets (<a title="Assets in Create" href="http://www.goocreate.com/learn/assets-in-create/" target="_blank">read more about Assets here</a>). There are two ways to create shareable Assets. You can either create the Asset directly from a shared Project, or you can copy personal assets into the Organization.
<h3>Directly to the Organization</h3>
When working in a shared Project, adding resources to the Asset Library will automatically share them with the Organization members. Simply click any of the Add to Asset Library buttons, enter details and click Add.

<span style="color: #ff0000">Note: At the time of writing, the title of the dialog is wrong. It says "Personal Library" but it's really "Organization Library". This will be fixed very soon. </span>

<h3>Copying a Personal Asset</h3>
If an Asset is in a personal, non-shared, library, it's easy to copy it to an Organization.

Go to the <strong>Dashboard</strong>, and select Assets in the left-hand menu. Locate the asset you want to share (<em>Personal Moonlander</em>), click the gearbox icon, and select <em>Copy To</em>.

Select the desired Organization. After copying, you should now have two copies of the asset. One personal, and one shared.
