## The moon surface

The first entity we're going to add a material to is the Moon surface. We have to import the material first before we can add it to the Moon surface. You can find the material in the *Asset Library*, in addition to many other things like skyboxes, 3D models and readymade scripts.

1. Click on the *Import Asset* button, which you can find next to the *Add Entity* button at the center top of the canvas
