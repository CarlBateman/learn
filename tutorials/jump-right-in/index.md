Welcome! This is a short tutorial which will take you all the way from scratch to a published Create project in just a few minutes. Jump in!
<h2>1. Start a Project and a Scene</h2>
If you don't have a Create account, start by going <a href="https://app.goocreate.com/user/register" target="_blank">here</a> and registering. If you have an account, just go ahead and <a href="https://app.goocreate.com/user/login" target="_blank">log in</a>. After logging in, you will be taken to the <strong>dashboard</strong>. The dashboard gives you an overview of your <b>scenes</b>, which are ordered into <strong>projects</strong>. Click the <em>create project</em> button at the top of the screen, and give your project a name. Then, create a scene. This will take you into the main interface of Create.

<h2>2. Import a Model</h2>
There are several ways to get models, textures and assets into Create. We'll use the very simple drag-and-drop functionality. For this, we need a 3D model. Start by downloading this .fbx file:
<p style="text-align: center">[button type="flat" shape="rounded" size="large" href="http://goolabs.wpengine.com/learn/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/08/goon2.zip"][icon type="download"]Download the Model[/button]</p>
Unzip it, open its folder and <em>drag and drop</em> the file straight onto the <strong>canvas</strong> of Create!

<em>Et voilá! </em>The 3D model has been imported into Create, and there is a <strong><a title="Entities and Components" href="//www.goocreate.com/learn/entities-and-components/" target="_blank">entity</a> </strong>named <em>goon</em> in the editor. It can be selected by clicking directly on it in the canvas, or clicking on the corresponding item in the right-hand <strong>hierarchy</strong> menu.

<h2>3. Pimp the Scene</h2>
<h3>Choose a Skybox</h3>
Another way of getting assets into the scene is using the <strong>asset library. </strong>To import an asset from the library, click the <em>asset library </em>button at the top of the interface.

<a href="http://goocreate.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2014/08/ass.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1137 aligncenter" src="http://goocreate.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2014/08/ass.jpg" alt="ass" width="349" height="35" /></a>

&nbsp;

This brings up the asset library, letting you import from various different sources. In the library drop-down, select <em>Goo. </em>Then find a <em>skybox</em>. For example, the Dystopia skybox. Click <strong>add</strong>, close the asset library and check out the scene!

The previously grey background has now been replaced by an image. Try looking around in the scene by clicking the right mouse button and dragging. If you still see the <strong>grid</strong>, you might want to hide it. The grid is toggled on and off with the little grid icon at the top. If you don't see the skybox, make sure that the <strong>skybox toggle</strong> (to the left of the grid toggle) is turned on!

Grid toggle selected." width="1219" height="609" /></a> The scene with a skybox. Grid toggle switched off.[/caption]
<h3>Add some Post Effects</h3>
Click the <strong>Scene</strong> in the right-hand menu and open the <strong>post effects</strong> panel to the left. From here, it's easy to add awesome effects to the scene. Feel free to experiment! For example, add a <em>Bloom</em> and an <em>Antialiasing</em> effect.

Make sure the post effects toggle is switched on!" width="1220" height="611" /></a> Showing some fancy post effects. Make sure the post effects toggle is switched on![/caption]
<h2>4. Publish</h2>
Once you're happy with the way the scene looks, click <em>Export</em> in the top menu and then click <em>Publish</em>.

This will bundle the web-ready sceneand upload it to a server, ready to share with anyone. Wait for the confirmation dialog to appear and click <em>view </em>to get to your brand new creation.

<h2>5. Try More Things</h2>
With your feet wet, there are tons of things to try next.
<ul>
	<li>Try importing 3D models of your own. There are plenty of resources with free 3D models on the net.</li>
	<li>Expand the hierarchy of the <em>goon</em> entity and find a node with a material and play with the material settings.</li>
	<li>Learn the <a title="Interface Overview" href="/learn/interface-overview/">basics of the interface</a>.</li>
	<li>Read more about <a title="Entities and Components" href="/learn/entities-and-components/">entities and components</a>.</li>
	<li>Check out the <a title="Creating a Goon" href="/learn/creating-a-goon/">Creating a Goon tutorial</a> for a more interactive Goon.</li>
	<li>Add animations to the goon. <a href="http://goolabs.wpengine.com/learn/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/08/goon_animations.zip">Here is a zip file</a> with a selection of animation states which can be dragged and dropped onto the<em> animation panel</em>. Set one animation as <em>initial state</em> and press <strong>play</strong>!</li>
</ul>
