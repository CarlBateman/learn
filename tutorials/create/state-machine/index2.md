## What is a state machine?

An example of a state machine is the flag in the scene above. It has two states: *up* and *down*. A *state* is simply a behavior of an object at a certain point in time.

Between the states, the flag has two *events* that make the *transition* from one state to another: *hoisting* and *lowering*. When the flag is in the *up* state, it is possible to use the *lowering* event, and when in the *down* state, it is possible to use the *hoisting* event.

A state machine is a collection of *States*, connected by *Transitions*. In Goo Create, a state machine is called a *Behavior*, and the entity needs a *State Machine Component* to add Behaviors to it.



## Step 1: Open the scene
The first thing you'll have to do is to open the scene we will work in for this tutorial:

1. <a href="https://create.goocreate.com/edit/aed83406fcb44bc3ab738c2ee8b4901b.scene" target="blank">Click here to open the scene</a>
2. If you're not logged in yet, log in with your Goo Create account
2. Click on 'Duplicate scene' in the top left corner
3. Select 'Drafts' and click on 'Duplicate'

## Step 2: Add a State Machine Component

A State machine component contains a collection of behaviors.


## Step 3: Add a Behavior


## Step 4: Add States

## Step 5: Add Tween Move actions

The *Tween Move* action

## Step 6: Add click actions


## Step 7: Add transitions
