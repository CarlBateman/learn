This tutorial will teach you how to create a basic state machine: a flag that can be pulled up or down.

Our flag is a very simple *State Machine*. It has two states: *up* and *down*. A *state* is simply a behavior of an object at a certain point in time.

The flag has two *events*: *pull up* and *pull down*. When the flag is in the *up* state, it is possible to use the *pull down* event, and when in the *down* state, it is possible to use the *pull up* event.

The *pull up* event will make the flag switch state from *down* to *up*. When a state machine switches state, we say that it makes a *transition*. Transitions are triggered by events and makes the state machine switch current state.

A state machine is a collection of *States*, connected by *Transitions*. In Goo Create, a state machine is called a *Behavior*, and the entity needs a *State Machine Component* to add Behaviors to it.


## Step 0: Add the Flag from the asset library


## Step 1: Add a State Machine Component

A State machine component contains a collection of behaviors.


## Step 2: Add a Behavior


## Step 3: Add States

Set off as starting state.


## Step 4: Add Tween Move actions

The *Tween Move* action

## Step 5: Add click actions


## Step 6: Add transitions


## Step 7: Done!
