## Step 1: Make an awesome app using Goo Create

* Be creative!
* Note that external links don't work from within the app. Read more in the [Cocoon docs](https://cocoonio.github.io/cocoon-canvasplus/dist/doc/js/Cocoon.App.html).


## Step 2: Export the scene as webpage

Click *Scene* -> *Export* -> *Webpage*


## Step 3: Go to cocoon.io and follow the instructions!

1. Register on [https://cocoon.io](cocoon.io).
2. Create a new Project by dropping the zip file.
3. Choose *WebView+* in the settings, and upload icons, splash screen images, etc.
4. Compile the app and download the APK file.


## Step 4: Make a key store

Android requires all apps to be digitally signed with a certificate before they can be installed. To sign your app, you need a key.

One way to make a key store is using [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/tools/publishing/app-signing.html#studio).

Click *Build* and then *Generate Signed APK...*.

In the first steps you will make a key for your app. Choose where to save the key. Then upload it to your project in Cocoon.io.


## Step 5: Submit your app to Google Play!

Submit your app to [Google Play](http://developer.android.com/distribute/googleplay/start.html)!

Done. You've now published a mobile app. Congrats!
